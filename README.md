# CryptoDashGraphQLServer

GraphQL server built using Express.js 

## Getting Started

To get the server up and running you must clone this project. Once you have opened this repository on your favorite text editor you must first run the following command on your terminal **npm install** to install all the dependencies for this project. 

I highly recommend installing **nodemon** as a development dependency. This package will watch your files for any changes so you don't have to restart the server every time. Run the following command on your terminal:
```
npm install -D nodemon
```

Once everything is installed run this command on your terminal **npm start**. This will start the server.
